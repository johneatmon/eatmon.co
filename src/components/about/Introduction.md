I summit mountains and volcanoes, and I build beautiful websites, too.

Building websites often feels like climbing a mountain — luckily, I am skilled at both. As your mountain guide, I will use my multidisciplinary toolkit in design, development, and strategy to turn your website woes into website _woah's!_

I've always loved wearing many hats. Drawing upon my undergraduate background in technical writing and a [seven-year tenure at an Orlando-based IT firm](/work/prosource), I deliver business value and delightful digital experiences in a myriad of roles.

Through research and writing, design and development, and strategy and process — we can do _great_ things together.
