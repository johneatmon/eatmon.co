This site is primarily typeset in [Söhne](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/soehne/) by Klim Type Foundry. The serif typeface scattered throughout is [Spectral](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Spectral) by Production Type — at least, until I can afford something like [Heldane Text](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/heldane-text/). Söhne is licensed to John Eatmon, Spectral is licensed under the Open Font License.

## Technologies

This website is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), some React, and a few [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) components. For a hollistic view of the technologies used, you can [check out the project on GitHub](https://github.com/johneatmon/eatmon.co).

## Services

This site is hosted for free by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and images are served by [Cloudflare Images](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-images/). The site is tracked with [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/), a privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics. The map on my [About](/about) page was made in [Felt](https://felt.com/), an absolutely delightful map-making tool.

## People

I owe many thanks to the friends, family, and acquaintances whom offered design feedback, technical support, and encouragement.
