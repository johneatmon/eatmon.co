A generalist product designer, front-end developer, and digital Swiss Army knife, I love solving user problems and meeting business objectives. I refine brand, content, and product strategy with a broad spectrum of skills.

Over the past few years, I've helped shape brand, design direction, and content in the tech industry. For nearly seven years, I've helped refine business processes, overcome workflow obstacles, and empathize with unique customer challenges. I'm currently leading design at Orlando technology services firm, [ProSource](https://www.getprosource.com/).

I'm lucky to call [Tacoma, Washington](https://felt.com/map/My-home-9AgWsx7e5SjCLf9Cghe0RG8A?lat=47.287317&lon=-122.391078&zoom=11.674049792376263) my home. I [hike around WA regularly](https://www.wta.org/@@backpacks/scrnm-jmaeat/trip-reports) and, one day, I'll've summited each of [WA's stratovolcanoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Cascade_volcanoes). So far I've summited one (Mt. Adams). When I'm not at my desk or out hiking, I can be found in the kitchen making French press or Chemex coffee and trialing gluten-free recipes.
