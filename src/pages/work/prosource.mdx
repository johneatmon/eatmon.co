I've worked at ProSource for nearly 7 years full-time now. It's virtually impossible to distill everything I've done into a single post, but I've done my best to break up the general categories of things based on work I've done.

## Product Design

## Front-End Development

## Brand & Visual Design

## Marketing

## Technical Writing

## Project Management

## Quoting, Sales & Procurement

## Workflow & Process Improvement
