This site is primarily typeset in [SÃ¶hne](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/soehne/) by Klim Type Foundry. The serif typeface scattered throughout is [Nuances Normal](https://blazetype.eu/typefaces/nuances-serif) by Blaze Type. My name on the homepage is typeset in [Hatton](https://pangrampangram.com/products/hatton) by PangramPangram. All typefaces used on this site are licensed to John Eatmon.

## Technologies

This website is built with [Astro](https://astro.build), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), some React, and a few [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) components. For a more hollistic view of the technologies used, you can [check out the project on GitHub](https://github.com/johneatmon/eatmon.co).

## Services

This site is hosted for free by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and images are served by [Cloudflare Images](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-images/). The site is tracked with [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/), a privacy-friendly alternative to Google Analytics. The map on the homepage was made in [Felt](https://felt.com/), an absolutely delightful map-making tool.

## People

I owe many thanks to the friends, family, and acquaintences whom offered design feedback, technical support, and encouragement &mdash; you know who you are.
