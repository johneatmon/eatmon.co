## Overview

Between 2021–2022, I created 4 landing pages tailored to specific industries or service offerings. These would be more hyper-focused on acquiring leads who otherwise wouldn’t be engaged on our main marketing website. The four landing pages:

- Hosted QuickBooks
- Hosted QuickBooks (with Intuit QuickBooks Solution Provider partnership)
- Healthcare IT
- Radiology IT

## Problem statement

It’s hard to captivate each and every prospect on the main marketing website. There were a few scenarios where sending a prospect to our main website wasn’t the best idea:

- **Referral links from partners:** For example, because we were an Intuit partner, they featured us on their authorized hosting page for QuickBooks Desktop. It made more sense to tailor a landing page specific to these prospects than to send them to our main website.
- **Cold outreach:** Any time we cold-called leads, we targeted one, specific industry at a time. Sending a tailored landing page that focuses only on the one industry would convert at a higher rate.
- **Conferences and speaking engagements:** We attend conferences or speak at events where we know our target audience will be. People from these conferences or events were more likely to book consultations with us if we solely focused on their exact goals.

I designed and developed 4 landing pages that were tailored to specific industries or offerings. I worked closely with our Director of Business Development to put together designs and copy that would speak to prospect pain points, challenges, and goals. Because our Director of Business Development engaged customers and leads frequently, he knew many of the common challenges these users faced. When we onboard new customers, we often ask what made them choose ProSource. Their answers regularly guide the copy on our websites.

## Goals

### Prospects

Prospects should learn more about the offering and how it meets their needs or goals. They will need pricing, availability, and features, too. Each landing page must clearly communicate the value of our services to make it easy for prospects to convert on the page.

### Business goals

We knew the bounce rate on any landing page would be higher than our main website. Our goal was for users to be interested in the specific service offering quickly then book an appointment with our Director of Business Development.

We primarily focused on our conversion rates to measure the performance of each landing page. Specifically, this was the ratio of leads booking appointments with our Business Development Director versus the total number of website visitors.

## Design process

Following our lean UX approach, I created a few quick wireframes to plot out answers to common pain points that leads bring to us. I also designed sections to answer questions before they are asked, specifically pertaining to pricing, availability, and included features.

Wireframes were vetted for cohesiveness by the Director of Business Development. We floated a few early iterations by relevant partners in the industry, too. For our Hosted QuickBooks landing pages, we sent wireframes to our Intuit QuickBooks Solution Provider partner. We showed our radiology page to a PACS provider.

### Elements of our landing pages

- **Focused:** No space was wasted, we cut right to the chase. Each landing page covered challenges, features, pricing (if applicable), and booking information.
- **Engaging:** We embedded relevant videos that supplemented related copy. Videos in the tech industry yield better conversions than text alone. It also puts a face to the name before a prospect books an appointment with our Business Development Director. For our healthcare landing page, I created a quiz that asks ten HIPAA-related questions to gauge how compliant the prospect was.
- **Quickly iterable:** All content needed to be easily replaceable. If our Director of Business Development uncovered a more pressing pain point or industry trend, I could change a few things and push changes to production within minutes.

### The HIPAA compliance quiz

We gated the quiz with an email capture. This way, even if a user didn’t complete the quiz, we still had their email in our HubSpot contact database. To make each quiz experience unique, I randomized the order of the questions.

After a user finishes the quiz, they receive a score and a recommendation for further action. A score of 7 or higher indicates that the user is adhering well to HIPAA compliance guidelines. A score lower than 7 prompts the user to schedule a free appointment with us to discuss ways to improve their security and policies. The user’s quiz results are attached to their contact object in HubSpot regardless of their score. If the user booked an appointment, we could preempt the gaps in their security and/or policies.

## Results

The landing pages have been instrumental for converting leads from cold outreach, conferences or speaking engagements, and backlinks from partners.

### By the numbers

Given that [most landing pages convert anywhere from 2–6%](https://unbounce.com/average-conversion-rates-landing-pages/), we were surprised to discover that ours averaged a 10% conversion rate. Most leads came from our partners’ backlinks, so perhaps these users were already more inclined to purchase from the get-go. It’s worth noting that I did count anyone who submitted their email address in our HIPAA quiz as a conversion, whether they booked a meeting with our Director of Business Development or not.
