## Overview

Mettle is a design system conceived to simplify the ideation and development cycles for ProSource's web projects and unify customer experiences across all surfaces. The name Mettle was chosen affectionately for its double entendre: the name sounds like the word "metal," which many technology products are created from; and, it also signifies the plucky spirit embodied by our company's small but effective team.

The design system is not as comprehensive like others for large, enterprise companies. Instead, it provides a solid core upon which all designs, layouts, and variants are built upon.

## Goals

While it may seem perplexing for such a small company to adopt a project like this, I had a few goals in mind when I began:

- Create a cohesive visual language across ProSource's surfaces (at the time of writing, this is 5 websites) and a handful of email templates.
- Simplify front-end development for me by drawing from a unified source of truth.
- Deliver a consistent and high-quality experience for end users.

## Process

Because I am a design and development team of one, I opted for a base UI kit to give me a solid framework and expedite the development process. Based on the amount of recommendations, I used Jordan Hughes' [Untitled UI Figma kit](https://www.untitledui.com/) as the starting point for Mettle.

### Typography

I used the type scale built into Untitled UI. It is nearly identical to the type scale used in the popular CSS framework, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-size). This reduced the cognitive load moving from design to development and kicked off the project with a shared starting point.

### Spacing

Spaces were based on the CSS unit, _rems_. And, as is commmon with many designs, I used a multiplier based on 8px (1rem = 16px, or 2 × 8px). Again, Untitled UI mirrored the base setup of Tailwind CSS in this way, too, which allowed me to quickly implement this design system.

### Colors

The color scales are tokens ranging from a 50–900. Generally, the base color would be assigned the token `500` with shades incrementing up and tints decrementing down from this midpoint. The only exception to this rule of thumb was actually our primary color, which is `indigo.600`. In addition to our primary color scale, I used a slate gray scale, two secondaries, and three scales for success, error, and warning UI elements.

Taking it a step further, I created a few choice gradients from the gray and primary (indigo) color scales. I also created a few guidelines for using the gray and primary colors as background and text, ensuring a minimum of WCAG 2.0 AA contrast.

## Front-End Development

Translating the design system in Figma into a smooth developer experience was relatively easy. Using Tailwind CSS, I created a base theme configuration that I can import into any project. Both the web framework and email framework I use support Tailwind CSS out of the box, so I only needed one configuration for both environments.

### Email templates using Maizzle

I use [Maizzle](https://maizzle.com/) to develop email templates. As mentioned, this allows me to use the same Tailwind configuration that I use for websites. The build script for our email templates inlines all of the custom styles so that they render properly in various email clients, like Outlook and Gmail.

### Component library in Astro

[Astro](https://astro.build/) is a next-gen web framework using island architecture to deliver top-notch DX without sacrificing blazing fast speed. All of the websites I develop for ProSource use Astro. Building a collection of tooling configurations, icons, and components was relatively easy. In fact, I based most of the architecture on Astro's own [Site Kit repository](https://github.com/withastro/site-kit).

## Experiments

As the design system and front-end library matures, I am simplifying the amount of repetition in the Figma file and GitHub repository. In Figma, I use variant properties to streamline properties and states, like size, color, and hover.

In the library, I am testing a package called [Class Variance Authority](https://github.com/joe-bell/cva) to streamline the logic between properties and states.

Here's a very early example for a Button using CVA, Tailwind CSS, and Astro:

```astro
---
import { cva, type VariantProps } from "class-variance-authority"

const button = cva(
	{/* Base button styles */}
	"transition-colors duration-150 ease-in-out w-full text-center sm:w-auto whitespace-nowrap",
	{
		{/* Styles for button variants */}
		variants: {
			{/* Primary/secondary button types (colors) */}
			type: {
				primary:
					"bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-700 active:bg-indigo-700 text-white border border-indigo-600 hover:border-indigo-700 active:border-indigo-700 outline-none ring-0 focus:ring-4 focus:ring-indigo-100",
				secondary:
					"bg-white hover:bg-gray-50 active:bg-gray-50 text-gray-700 border border-gray-300 outline-none ring-0 focus:ring-4 focus:ring-gray-100",
			},
			{/* The size of the button, based on the Figma design system */}
			size: {
				small: "py-2 px-[14px] text-sm font-bold shadow-sm rounded-lg",
				medium: "px-4 py-[10px] text-sm font-bold shadow-sm rounded-lg",
				large: "px-[18px] py-[9px] text-base font-medium shadow-sm rounded-lg",
				xlarge: "px-5 py-3 text-base font-medium shadow-sm rounded-lg",
				xxlarge: "px-7 py-[17px] text-base font-medium shadow-lg rounded-lg",
			},
			{/* Styles if an icon is used on the button */}
			icon: {
				yes: "inline-flex gap-2",
				no: "inline-block",
			},
			{/* Styles when the button is in a disabled state */}
			disabled: {
				true: "cursor-not-allowed opacity-60",
				false: "",
			},
		},
		{/* Compound variants are a default state when using the button component */}
		compoundVariants: [{ type: "primary", size: "medium", icon: "no", disabled: false }],
	},
)

export interface Props extends VariantProps<typeof button>, astroHTML.JSX.HTMLAttributes {}

const {
	type = "primary",
	size = "medium",
	disabled = false,
	class: className = "",
	...attrs
} = Astro.props

{/* If the `href` passed to the button contains 'https:', it is considered an external link */}
attrs.href && attrs.href.toString().includes("https:")
	? (Astro.props.external = true)
	: (Astro.props.external = false)

{/* Slot management for icons before/after button text */}
const icon = Astro.slots.has("before") || Astro.slots.has("after") ? "yes" : "no"
---

<a
	href={attrs.href}
	class={button({ type, size, icon, disabled })}
	target={attrs.external ? "_blank" : ""}
	rel={attrs.external ? "nofollow noopener noreferer" : ""}
>
	<slot name="before" />
	<slot />
	<slot name="after" />
</a>
```

More work needs to be done to integrate CVA into Mettle, but the results so far have been promising.
