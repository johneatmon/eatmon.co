ProSource is an Orlando-based technology services provider focused on proving IT solutions to high-complexity industries like healthcare, engineering, finance, and manufacturing. Their mission is to empower teams with thoughtful IT solutions that put people first.

In 2021, ProSource underwent the biggest rebrand since its founding in 2006. I was the designer and developer responsible for aligning the website to the new company brand and building out new content pages to broaden the company's content strategy. I worked closely with the ProSource leadership team to deliver a website that would attract more prospects, perform better in search rankings, and match the new brand's aesthetic.

## Project summary

The existing website used a WordPress theme that lacked personality and looked boilerplate. Moreover, competitors using the same theme as us ended up looking too similar.
The existing website didn't prioritize important information that prospects — and customers — would want right away. The website didn't present a clear CTA on each page, so there was no cohesive customer journey.
The redesign addressed these issues by serving important information to users quickly, creating a cohesive journey at key touch-points, and by establishing a new visual aesthetic that was unique for our size and space.

## Problems

The existing website suffered from [Corporate Memphis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_Memphis). The lack of personality created brand distrust and didn't resonate with users. The second most trafficked page on our website was the About Us page. Our prospects want IT partners they can trust and depend on, but our About Us page contained few details about who we were and very little images of our team. Not having a unique visual style meant we could not stand out from competitors either.

Our website buried important details that prospects and customers would want right away, like our contact details, hours of operation, ways of creating tickets, and our address.

### Business problem

Because there was no brand trust and the website did not serve important information to users, we had:

- A high bounce rate. Our monthly average bounce rate was around 85% with a time on page of less than 2 minutes. Users would visit the homepage, then the About Us page, then leave.
- Low conversion rates. Our disjointed user journey confused prospects and led to very few conversions on the website.

## User goals

### Customers

We want users to find the resources they need with minimal friction. Contact details should be readily available, many customers forget our support email or phone number and need to quickly grab it from the website to submit an IT ticket.

### Prospects

Prospects also like looking through our case studies, team information, and webinars to learn more about our offerings and the technology landscape in general.

## Business Goals

Beyond aligning the redesign with the new brand, we wanted to increase user retention, conversion rates, and surface important information. We looked at our analytics to measure the impact of the redesign, primarily bounce rate and time on page. We also wanted to compare the quantity of conversions before and after the website relaunch.

## A lean UX approach

Because of our limited resources, most of the design process was based on hypotheses to increase user retention and elevate visual design. I employed a lean UX approach by working designing and developing MVPs and iteratively changing content with A/B testing.

### A cohesive customer journey

- **CTAs:** Clear and consistent CTAs push prospects to book consultations with our director of business development.
- **Content:** Blog posts, webinars, case studies, and gated PDFs were organized with new layouts and also indexed on a singular Resources page.
- **Contact info:** Existing customers get the info they need to submit IT tickets quickly. Prospects are able to book consultations asynchronously using HubSpot's meeting widget.

### A distinct visual identity

- **Goodbye, Corporate Memphis:** Gone are the lifeless illustrations and overused stock photography. We incorporated more photos of our team and office. If we had to use stock photography, we selected assets that looked more warm and welcoming and would resonate more with our buyers.
- **Bespoke:** The WordPress site was ditched in favor of a Jamstack framework called Astro. Astro allows me to iterate the website quickly and deploy new designs in seconds through repository commits on GitHub. Netlify's branch testing feature allows me to easily A/B test new features, content, and patterns.
- **Simplicity:** The design had to be simple above all else. The overwhelming majority of customers and prospects aren't versed in the technical nitty-gritty of our technology stack. I prioritized trustworthiness, clarity, and visual appeal by removing excess details and injecting little bits of personality throughout.
  I engaged our existing customers early on in the process by soliciting feedback through a survey and we also conducted a handful of guerrilla interviews with our more longstanding customers. The survey and interviews centered around the qualitative aspects of the design, but they did draw out areas to reduce IT jargon in our marketing copy to make it more appealing to less tech-savvy prospects.

## Results

With the redesign, customers can quickly find the information they need. Prospects are given a complete and clear customer journey, with touch-points on content pages like our webinars, blog posts, and case studies. The new visual design prioritizes clarity, trustworthiness, and professionalism and discards the clinical WordPress boilerplate theme look.

### By the numbers

Since the redesign, development, and launch of 60+ pages of website content, we've noticed a marked improvement in our analytics:
The bounce rate decreased sharply, from about 85% to a new monthly average of 72%.
The time on page increased slightly as well, from less than 2 minutes to about 3 minutes.
We've not gained significantly more conversions on our main marketing website. This may be in part due to some SEO catching up that needs further work, as we simply don't command a large volume of visitors monthly.

## Anecdotal, qualitative data

The feedback we've received from customers, prospects, and partners has been overwhelmingly positive. Many customers have commented that our new brand and website make us look like an enterprise company. Some prospects were shocked to learn that we're only a team of a dozen. We've also had other partners come up to us at conferences and tell us that they really like the way our website looks and feels.
