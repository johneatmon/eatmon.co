You want to use `font-display: swap` in your project‚Äôs CSS to boost your page loading speed. But when you do, this happens:

<LazyImage
	src="https://imagedelivery.net/le40TwFDWUdIvXckEp8FBw/4836af36-9e63-42c0-f43e-a39c2db02900/public"
	alt="A visual demonstration of cumulative layout shift caused by font-display swap."
/>

Ugh! That annoying shift when your font files do load contributes to the cumulative layout shift (CLS)
of your page. The more CLS there is, the more points will be deducted from your Google Lighthouse score.
Bummer!

## Why Fontaine

[Fontaine](https://github.com/danielroe/fontaine) is a Vite plugin written by [Daniel Roe](https://github.com/danielroe) that helps you optimize a fallback font. The plugin uses [Capsize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@capsizecss/core) to analyze your typeface and create font metrics for ascenders and descenders accordingly. Those are fancy-schmancy CSS features that are [decently supported across browsers](https://caniuse.com/?search=FontFace%20API%20override) (just waiting on Webkit üòê). Using this technique, a fallback system font will occupy about the same visual space as your preferred type. When your custom type does finally swap in, there won‚Äôt be a jarring layout shift. Pretty nifty, huh?

## Getting started

Let's get this added to an Astro project! In my example, I will be using Tailwind CSS, but you certainly don‚Äôt have to. Feel free to use whichever CSS framework (or just plain ol‚Äô CSS) your heart desires.

Let‚Äôs create a bare-bones Astro project with Tailwind CSS. To do that, we‚Äôll run this command:

```bash
pnpm create astro@latest -- --template with-tailwindcss
```

Next, we‚Äôll add in the Fontaine package:

```bash
pnpm add fontaine
```

## Add your font files

Now, we‚Äôll want to add our font files to Astro‚Äôs `/public` directory. This directory is where static assets that won‚Äôt be processed by Astro live. I like to keep my font files organized by typeface and file type, but feel free to do whatever floats your boat.

```
your-astro-project/
‚îú‚îÄ public/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ fonts/
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ SpaceGrotesk/
‚îÇ      ‚îú‚îÄ ttf/
‚îÇ        ‚îú‚îÄ SpaceGrotesk-Regular.ttf
```

You can use Google Fonts or Adobe Typekit ‚Äî but hosting your own font files is preferred [for a litany of reasons](https://termageddon.com/google-fonts-violates-gdpr/). If you do choose Google Fonts or Typekit, you will need to adjust the Fontaine URL in the Astro config accordingly.

Now we‚Äôll need to write some `@font-face` rules to tell our browser where to locate our font files. If you‚Äôre writing with SCSS, you can [use this handy function I wrote](https://gist.github.com/johneatmon/dad7af4fc864f245630ec90bd21c8637) to load in a bunch of font files cleanly.

```css
/* fonts.css */
@font-face {
	font-family: "Space Grotesk";
	src: url("/fonts/SpaceGrotesk/SpaceGrotesk-Regular.ttf") format("truetype");
	font-style: normal;
	font-weight: 400;
	font-display: swap;
	unicode-range: U+0000-00FF, U+0131, U+0152-0153, U+02BB-02BC, U+02C6, U+02DA, U+02DC, U+2000-206F,
		U+2074, U+20AC, U+2122, U+2191, U+2193, U+2212, U+2215, U+FEFF, U+FFFD;
}
```

Once you‚Äôve written this CSS, you will need to import it in an Astro file so that your project will actually use it. If you use a base `<head />` component, that would be a good spot; otherwise, a layout file would work, too.

## Config files

We need to do two final things to get this to work. First, we need to reference our custom type in our `tailwind.config.cjs` file. What I generally do is extend the default sans-serif font stack. You can do that like so:

```js
// tailwind.config.cjs
const defaultTheme = require("tailwindcss/defaultTheme")

module.exports = {
	theme: {
		extend: {
			fontFamily: {
				sans: ["Space\\ Grotesk", ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.sans],
			},
		},
	},
}
```

Excellent! Now, we‚Äôre going to tell Tailwind to try our backup typeface if our primary one isn‚Äôt available. By default, the specially-adjusted Fontaine font is the name of your typeface appended with `override`. So we will reference that in our Tailwind like so:

```js
sans: ["Space\\ Grotesk", "Space\\ Grotesk\\ override", ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.sans]
```

In our `astro.config.mjs` file, we will add the Fontaine plugin and give it our config. With Fontaine, you can specify many font fallbacks, but only the first in your array will be used for the adjustment calculations. Because we already have fallbacks specified in our Tailwind config, there's really only value in using one fallback font. I choose Arial for sans-serif typefaces because it‚Äôs pretty much [guaranteed to be installed on any machine](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/system_font_web_safe_font).

We tell Fontaine where to locate our font files like this:

```js
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config"
import { FontaineTransform } from "fontaine"

export default defineConfig({
	vite: {
		plugins: [
			FontaineTransform.vite({
				fallbacks: ["Arial"],
				resolvePath: (id) => new URL(`./public${id}`, import.meta.url), // id is the font src value in the CSS
			}),
		],
	},
})
```

And that‚Äôs it! If we‚Äôve done everything correctly, we should be able to run our build command error-free:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can check to make sure Fontaine is working by inspecting the `/dist` folder where Astro spits out completed builds. In the `/dist` folder, there‚Äôs an `_astro` directory, and inside of that there should be a `.css` file. Opening it, you should see a declaration like this at the start of the file (mine was minified):

```css
@font-face {
	font-family: Space Grotesk override;
	src: local("Arial");
	ascent-override: 98.4%;
	descent-override: 29.2%;
	line-gap-override: 0%;
}
```

_Voil√† !_ We have success.

Mixed with a couple of other font loading strategies ‚Äî [prefetching font files, subsetting for Latin alphabets, self-hosting your font files, caching your font files](https://leerob.io/blog/fonts) ‚Äî we can also use `font-display: swap` without having to worry about jarring layout shifts (on non-Webkit browsers).

## Working example

I would love to hear your thoughts and feedback, feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:john@eatmon.co) or [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/johneatmon_). I am always open to improvements to this tutorial or my code example.

Until next time, <em>au revoir !</em>
