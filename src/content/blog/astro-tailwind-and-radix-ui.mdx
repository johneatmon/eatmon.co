I'm going to walk through my process to get Radix UI primitives working in Astro with Tailwind CSS.

The stack we will be using (RAT stack? ðŸ¤”):

- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/)
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Project setup

We'll start by creating a brand new Astro project. To make things easier on ourselves, we'll use Astro's React template since we will need React for our Radix UI primitives:

```bash
pnpm create astro@latest -- --template framework-react
```

### Add Tailwind CSS

Next, we'll need to add Tailwind CSS. We will be adding the Radix-specific configs in just a moment.

You can use the Astro command-line tool to help you add Tailwind:

```bash
pnpm astro add tailwind
```

Or, you can add it manually:

```bash
pnpm add @astrojs/tailwind tailwindcss
```

### Adding Radix

You have a few options getting Radix and Tailwind to play nicely together:

1. The Radix team recently [added support for Tailwind CSS styling](https://twitter.com/radix_ui/status/1626219141647728641) of the primitives in their docs. You can use their provided configuration file and code.
2. [shadcn](https://twitter.com/shadcn) has created beautiful UI components from all of the Radix primitives and Tailwind CSS. The code can be dropped into any project as-is.
3. I personally use the [Tailwind CSS Raidix](https://tailwindcss-radix.vercel.app/) project by [Florentin Eckl](https://twitter.com/ecklflorentin) because I find the examples a bit more stripped back and easier to modify. I'm going to use this package for this tutorial, but feel free to choose whichever approach you prefer.
