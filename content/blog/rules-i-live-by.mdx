For most of my adult life, I suffered from depression. I hadn't realized how bad it was until I took control of my life and made drastic changes. I lived in a place I hated, I worked a job that brought me little joy, I was overweight, and I had no mechanisms to deal with stress or anxiety.

I've since made a lot of changes in my life, and I'm doing better than I've ever been. I'm not a doctor, and I'm not a therapist, but I wanted to share some of the things that have helped me live a happier and healthier life.

## Don't ignore mental health

It took me a long time to recognize that I was not okay. It's very normal to feel melancholy from time to time, but I increasingly felt a sense of dread, despair, and hopelessness on a regular basis.

It took a few weeks of antidepressants before I noticed a significant change. Antidepressants were absolutely instrumental to my progress but they were not the only change I made. I also made many changes in diet, exercise, and habits to better help me handle my depression.

## Invest in quality friendships

When my wife and I moved to the PNW, we didn't know anyone. We had no friends or family in the area. I was working from home, and we were both very lonely. It may sound silly, but I downloaded Bumble BFF and made a commitment to engage earnestly with people I matched with on there. Through early friendships I made on Bumble, my network grew.

I also decided I would say _yes_ to new experiences and invites rather than letting myself back out. I am fortunate to have the support of a great network of friends to rely on.

## Make exercise habitual

The first thing I did was start going to the gym 2–3 times per week. I started with a simple routine of 30 minutes of weight training and 20 minutes of cardio. I didn't have a specific goal in mind, I wanted to make this a regular habit that stuck.

When you're starting out, it's okay to use the cable machines. In fact, it helps prevent injury and helps you maintain your form. If you're unsure about how to start weightlifting, I would recommend using all of the machines available to you at your gym.

Recently, I switched to free weights with just dumbbells — yes, you can create an entire weightlifting program for yourself with _just_ dumbbells.

**Here's my current workout regimen:**

### Monday, Wednesday, Friday

- 5 minutes of stretching
- 3x8 [Walking lunges](https://youtu.be/0A3EgOztptQ?t=39)

### Tuesday, Thursday

I start with a 5 minute warmup, then I alternate between 1 minute of running and 1 minute of walking for 30–45 minutes. I finish with a 5 minute cool-down.

### Saturday, Sunday

I might finish my week with a ~10 mi. hike or walks outside. I try to get outside as much as possible.

## Eat less

When I moved to Washington, I was ~186 lbs. I gained a lot of weight during COVID. I wasn't very active and my diet was horrible. My wife and I went out to eat (mostly fast food) 3–4 times per week.

When I moved to Washington, I aggressively cut down on the amount of meals I ate. I started intermittent fasting and only ate between 3pm and 9pm. I didn't worry about counting calories because I knew I wouldn't keep up with it. I instead focused on eating less. Since moving to the PNW in the summer of 2021, I've lost about 30 lbs.

I've been gluten-free since I discovered I may have Celiac disease about 5 years ago. Though this doesn't automatically make my diet healthier, cutting out gluten has helped me reduce carb intake and generally make me think twice about what I eat.

When possible, I try to maximize protein intake. I aim for 120+ grams of protein per day, but this is very difficult to do with intermittent fasting, so I may try supplements.

## Make positive habits

- I've found that I'm most productive when I have a routine. I try to wake up at the same time every day, and I try to go to bed at the same time every day. I aim for 8 hours of sleep every night. Sleep is the foundation of a healthy life, mentally and physically. You will disproportionately improve your life by improving your sleep.
- I drink three cups of coffee per day, but I make sure I don't have caffeine after noon. I also drink a lot of water throughout the day. I hardly ever drink soda, and I limit alcohol to 2–3 times per month.
- I try to limit social media (excluding YouTube) use to 30 minutes per day. I use [Screen Time](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208982) to limit my usage.
- Beginning in January of this year, I started reading a book every month. This goal is very achievable, on average I'm only reading 10–15 pages per day.

## Spend consciously

My wife and I somehow managed to keep very good credit scores (750+) even though the rest of our personal finances were a wreck. Despite our scores, we had a lot of debt between the two of us, little to no savings, and no plan for the future.

I read [_I Will Teach You to Be Rich_](https://a.co/d/i1ENCbm) by Ramit Sethi, and have implemented his plan in my own life. My wife and I now have a conscious spending plan, a retirement plan, and a plan to pay off all our debt within the next 10 years.

## Go outdoors

The outdoors mean a lot to me. I recharge when I'm away from my desk and in nature. My family chose to move to the PNW because of the abundance of outdoor activities. I try to get outside as much as possible, whether it's a day hike, backpacking trip, or a walk along Puget Sound.

You may have something else that helps you recharge. Whatever it is, make time for it and be aggressive about keeping your appointment.

## Conclusion

Achieving goals is a marathon, not a sprint. I was not able to do all of these things at once. Habits and goals are like building muscles. When you don't use them, they atrophy. Over time, though, by showing up for yourself, you can build them up again.

Once things become habitual, it's okay to skip a few days here and there. Allow yourself the grace to make mistakes. When you've (re)learned to show up for yourself, you can always get back on track.
