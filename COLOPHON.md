# Colophon

The technologies, services, and people that empowered me to build this website.

## How it's built

Here's the tech stack:

- Front-end: Next.js 14 + Radix UI
- Styles: Tailwind CSS
- Email: Resend and React Email
- Content: Contentlayer + MDX
- Hosting: Vercel
- Domain/DNS: Cloudflare
- Analytics: Vercel Analytics

I also wanted to include more than one typeface, I'm using:

- Serif: [Gestura Text VF](https://www.socio-type.com/demo/gestura-text) from Sociotype
- Sans serif: [Geist](#) from Vercel and Basement Studio
