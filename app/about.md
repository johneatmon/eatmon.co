I'm a Seattle-based software engineer with a penchant for React, TypeScript, and typo&shy;graphy, currently residing in the heart of Seattle.

I'm currently building insurance software at UnitedHealthcare. Before this, I worked
at an Orlando-based IT firm for 7+ years, where [I did everything from front-end web development to sales and marketing](https://read.cv/johneatmon/npsVXnwnPLc03Cfs6863).

When I'm not tinkering with code, you can find me climbing mountains, reading, or perfecting my
coffee brews.
