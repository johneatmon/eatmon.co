I'm a Seattle-based software engineer inter&shy;ested in React, TypeScript, and typo&shy;graphy, currently residing in the heart of&nbsp;Seattle.

I'm currently building insurance software at UnitedHealthcare. Before this, I worked
at an Orlando-based IT firm for 7+ years, where [I did everything from front-end web development to sales and&nbsp;marketing](https://read.cv/johneatmon/npsVXnwnPLc03Cfs6863).

When I'm not tinkering with code, you can find me [climbing mountains](https://www.wta.org/@@backpacks/scrnm-jmaeat), [reading](https://literal.club/johneatmon), or perfecting my coffee&nbsp;brews.
