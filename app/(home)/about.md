I'm a software engineer with a passion for React, TypeScript, and typography, currently residing in the heart of&nbsp;Seattle.

I work on insurance software at UnitedHealthcare. Prior to this, I spent over 7 years at an Orlando-based IT firm, where [I was involved in everything from front-end web development to sales and&nbsp;marketing](https://read.cv/johneatmon/npsVXnwnPLc03Cfs6863).

Outside of coding, you can find me [climbing mountains](https://www.wta.org/@@backpacks/scrnm-jmaeat), [reading](https://literal.club/johneatmon), or perfecting my coffee&nbsp;brews.
