I'm a software engineer with a passion for React, TypeScript, and typography, currently residing in the heart of&nbsp;Seattle.

Right now, I'm building insurance software at United&shy;Healthcare. Before this, I spent over 7 years at an Orlando-based IT firm, where [I did everything from front-end web development, graphic design, and technical writing to low-level IT support, sales, and marketing](https://read.cv/johneatmon/npsVXnwnPLc03Cfs6863).

Outside of coding, you can find me [climbing mountains](https://www.wta.org/@@backpacks/scrnm-jmaeat), [reading](https://literal.club/johneatmon), or perfecting my coffee&nbsp;brews.
